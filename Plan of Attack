Thinking two modules needed for the pencil/it's actions and the paper with convenience functions. 

First define paper:
PAPER 
    Properties:
        pageBody
    Functions:
        clear
        getText
        addText
        eraseText
        editText
        CLEAR 
            PAPER removes all existing text
        getText
            PAPER returns currently written characters
        addText 
            PAPER appends provided text to currently written text 
        eraseText 
            PAPER removes right most occurence of provided text if it exists
        editText
            PAPER replaces overlaps with @ and maintains characters that would fit into spaces
            PAPER replaces overwrites left most erased space.

Second define pencil:
PENCIL 
    Properties:
        Point Durability
        Length
        Eraser Durability
    Functions:
        WRITE 
            tells PAPER what to add. 
            PAPER adds text
            PENCIL decrements Point Durability (except spaces and new lines)
        ERASE 
            tell PAPER what to erase 
            PAPER erases last instance (if it exists)
            PENCIL Eraser Durability decrements 
        SHARPEN 
            PENCIL reduces Length by 1
            PENCIL regains initial Point Durability
        EDIT 
            PENCIL tells PAPER what to put into edit 
            PAPER converts would be overlaps to @ (maintaining the original character for existing spaces)
            PAPER overwrites edit in left most erased area (if it exists)
            PENCIL decrements Point Durability (except spaces and new lines)

Potential difficulties:
    The edit text portion of this code, namely maintaining the overwriting text where spaces currently exist 
    will be the most challenging aspect of this code.
